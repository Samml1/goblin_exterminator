# goblin_exterminator
Python project for learning all sorts

At tthe end of this project this should hopefuly be a functioning text
adventure game written in Python where the goal is to travel accross
the lands exterminating goblins.

TO DO:
- ~~create yml format to create dungeons programatically~~
  - ~~read yml format using pyYaml or other lib~~
- segment and compartmentalise the codebase to prevent it from becoming too unweildy
- create dungeons
- create enemy class
- create combat function for random encounters
  - this will require an XP system of some variety
  - add more stats for the player and enemies
  - create different weapons to use
- create loot system
  - give players a reason to fight
  - 
- ~~update player class to have HP and stats~~
